      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Many viruses and worms find email addresses on the infected system and send themselves to these addresses. They do this by connecting directly to the email servers whose names they have harvested from the local system. This rule prevents any process from talking to a foreign email server using SMTP. By blocking this communication, a machine may become infected with a new mass-mailing virus, but that virus will be unable to spread further by email. It prevents outbound access to SMTP ports 25 and 587 on all programs except known email clients listed as an exclusion.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

The “About” dialog box will be displayed, showing, among other information, the current DAT version installed and the date of that DAT version.
Guidance in DTAM016 requires updates be run daily, automatically or manually. If compliant, the DAT date will be within 24-48 hours old. Since automated update tasks’ success is not guaranteed, the expectation is for update task success to be frequently monitored and corrected when unsuccessful. To allow for that correction, the minimum acceptable threshold for DAT date is not to exceed 7 days. 

If the DAT date displayed is more than “7” days old, this is a finding.

If the vendor or trusted site's files match the date of the signature files on the machine, this is not a finding.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This rule will block any common programs from running from the Temp directory; however, this rule is much more restrictive in that it stops nearly all processes from launching in the Temp folder. Most viruses need to be run once by a person before infecting a computer. This can be done in many ways, such as opening an executable attachment in an email or downloading a program from the Internet. An executable needs to exist on the disk before Windows can run it. A common way for applications to achieve this is to save the file in the user's or system's Temp directory and then run it. One purpose of this rule is to enforce advice that is frequently given to users: "do not open attachments from email." The other purpose of this rule is to close security holes introduced by application bugs. Older versions of Outlook and Internet Explorer are notorious for automatically executing code without the user needing to do anything but preview an email or view a website.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

    <Rule id="V-59365" severity="medium" conversionstatus="pass" title="DTAM170--Access Protection block execution of all programs from temp folder" dscresource="None">
      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This rule will block any executable from running from the Temp directory; however, this rule is much more restrictive in that it stops nearly all processes from launching in the Temp folder. This provides the most protection, but also has a higher chance of blocking a legitimate application from being installed.
Intention: Most viruses need to be run once by a person before infecting a computer. This can be done in many ways, such as opening an executable attachment in an email, downloading a program from the Internet, etc. For example, &lt;http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_101034.htm&gt;.
An executable needs to exist on the disk before Windows can run it. A common way for applications to achieve this is to save the file in the user’s or system’s Temp directory and then run it.
One purpose of this rule is to enforce advice that is frequently given to people: “don’t open attachments from email.” The other purpose of this rule is to close security holes introduced by application bugs. Older versions of Outlook and Internet Explorer are notorious for automatically executing code without the user needing to do anything but preview an email or view a website.
Risks: All applications that are protected by these rules offer alternatives to running executables, such as saving them somewhere else on the disk and running from there. So the downside of the rules is that users may need to learn a few extra steps before doing things they can do more quickly now.
Note: Enabling this rule may prevent some applications from functioning outright.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Antivirus software vendors use collective intelligence from sensors and cross-vector intelligence from web, email, and network threats to compile scores that reflect the likelihood of whether a file in question is malware. The collective intelligence is constantly being updated, more frequently than the typical daily antivirus signature files. With File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running antivirus software, since by querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious, up-to-the-minute intelligence is provided. This type of protection reduces the threat protection time period from days to milliseconds, increases malware detection rates, and reduces downtime and remediation costs associated with malware attacks.
